# odin-recipes
A website featuring some of my favorite recipes

This recipe project that I will be embarking on is going to be a fun way for me to test the basic HTML skills that I have just aquired through the Odin Project. The most difficult and most new-to-me aspect about this project will be that I will be using the terminal and Git to get most of the project done.

In this project, I will be using the following elements:
    headers
    paragraphs
    images
    links
    ordered lists
    unordered lists
    line items 

Other skills that I will demonstrate are going to be:
    boilerplate usage
    directory/file creation through terminal
    directory/file navigation
    terminal and Git usage

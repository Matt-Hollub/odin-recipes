    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This curry recipe is a delicious rich tomato based curry dish. In this recipe we like to use pumpkin when it’s in season but you can easily use sweet potato or butternut squash and make it any time of year. We like to leave the skin on our veg where possible as thats where lots of the fiber is. Curry recipes like many Indian dishes uses a lot of spices to give a great depth of flavor but don’t worry if you don’t have all the ground spices, you can simply use curry powder and a bit of chili if you like. We love this recipe as it’s highly adaptable to whatever you have in the fridge and cupboard, simply use your favorite veg, cooked beans, and any leafy greens you like.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is such a tasty delicious meal that only takes 15 mins to make, use rice noodles for a GF version</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Pasta</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300 g Wholewheat or brown rice noodles</li>
        <li>15 g piece of ginger</li>
        <li>1 red chili</li>
        <li>1 bunch of scallions / spring onions</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>150 g oyster mushrooms or mushroom of choice</li>
        <li>1 head of bak choi / 100 g spinach</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dressing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250 ml coconut milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp peanut butter</li>
        <li>juice of 2 limes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp maple syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Garnish</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 g fresh coriander / basil</li>
        <li>3 tbsp salted roasted peanuts</li>
        <li>pickled ginger</li>
        <li>wedges of lime</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the noodles in a pot of boiling water and cook as per instructions on the back of the packet (usually takes 4-5 minutes). Remove from heat, drain and rinse with cold water in a colander over the sink.
        </li>
        <li>It’s best to prep all the veg first, as this is a fast cooking dish cooked on a high heat in about 5 minutes. Peel and finely chop the ginger. Remove the end off the chilli and finely slice (leave the seeds in only if you like it hot). Finely slice the scallions / spring onions, remove any limp outer leaves and finely chop the green parts. Grate the carrot. Finely chop the mushrooms. Remove the nub at the end of the pak choi and finely chop.
        </li>
        <li>Put 1.5 tablespoons of oil into a non-stick large-bottomed pan (ideally a wok) on a high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the ginger and chilli, and cook for 1 minute, stirring regularly.
        </li>
        <li>Add the mushrooms, scallions and the grated carrot with 1 tsp salt .Cook for further  5 minutes, stirring as it cooks.
        </li>
        <li>In a cup, mix together the dressing ingredients, using a fork (do not worry if it stays a bit lumpy and the coconut milk does not break up completely, it will do once it’s added to the pan).
        </li>
        <li>Add the dressing in to the pan and stir through thoroughly, so that it coats all the veg well. Cook for another 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Next, add the cooked noodles and the chopped pak choi and cook for another few minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the heat. Roughly chop the fresh coriander or basil and use them as garnish for each serving together with sprinkles of roasted peanuts.
        </li>
        <li>It’s nice served with some pickled ginger and a wedge of lime on each serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
